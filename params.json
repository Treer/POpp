{"name":"popp","tagline":"a PO file preprocessor for Gnu .po language translation/localization files.","body":"#### Features\r\n\r\nThe preprocessor allows your translated text to reference\r\nto other items of translated text, in a way that should work within any .PO editor. See the [GNU gettext documentation](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/index.html) for information about PO files.\r\n\r\nFor example, you can have .PO source files like this:\r\n\r\n    msgid \"ProductName short\"\r\n    msgstr \"POpp\"\r\n    \r\n    msgid \"Welcome text\"\r\n    msgstr \"Congratulations on your download of {id:productname short}\"\r\n    \r\nand it can be converted automatically to this:\r\n\r\n    msgid \"ProductName short\"\r\n    msgstr \"POpp\"\r\n    \r\n    msgid \"Welcome text\"\r\n    msgstr \"Congratulations on your download of POpp\"\r\n\r\npopp also allows .PO files to contain $include statements. Conditional directives might be added in future.\r\n\r\n#### Current version:\r\n  * **The Windows executable can be [downloaded here](https://mega.co.nz/#!zYkiSDIA!zzQkqeOChgqUiUYsXKQDNaW1X0ZMdw2suyYrrbtUFt4)** (v0.12)\r\n   - md5: f60c75ad0efeb28194430cd62ab0a9ce *popp.exe\r\n  * I'm still in the process of trying popp in a real project environment, so for now assume it's only been tested with the automatic test cases, and take care.\r\n\r\n## Documentation:\r\n\r\nExpands .po msgstrs which reference other msgstr values via a curly brace\r\nnotation, for example `{id:ProductName_short}` will be expanded to the msgstr\r\nwhich has the msgid of `ProductName_short`.\r\n\r\n#### Usage:                                                                                                                                                                         \r\n    popp [options] source.popp [dest.po]\r\n\r\n#### Brace notation:\r\n\r\n * `{id:msgid}` or `{id:msgid-msgctxt}`\r\n * references can be escaped with a backslash, e.g. `\\{id:msgid}` is ignored.\t\r\n\t\r\n**WARNING**: Plural forms are not supported, the file can still be processed,\r\nhowever lines begining with \"msgstr[_n_]\" will not have their content expanded,\r\nand plural forms cannot be referenced with the brace notation.\r\n\r\n#### $include notation\r\n\r\nThe following include statements are all valid notation\r\n\r\n    $include \"file.po\"\r\n\r\n    # $include \"file.po\"\r\n    #.$include \"file.po\"\r\n\r\nUse the hash-comment notation if you want the file to editable in a .PO editor \r\nor tool before it will be passed through popp.\r\n\r\n#### Output, and pipes\r\n\r\nOutput files are written in UTF-8. If your source languages use unicode\r\ncharacters that your shell can't display, then avoid using pipes and stick with \r\nspecifying an input file and an output file. Or proceed *very* carefully, as you \r\nrisk having the unicode characters mapped to what the shell can handle.\r\n\r\n#### Options:\r\n\r\n* -nl, --nLF\r\n\r\n Use LF for newlines\r\n* -nc, --nCRLF\r\n\r\n Use CRLF for newlines\r\n* -ns, --nSource\r\n\r\n _[Default]_ Determines LF or CRLF for newlines by what the source file uses\r\n* -q, --quiet\r\n\r\n Suppresses console error messages and info messages\r\n\r\n* -s, --sensitive, --casesensitive\r\n\r\n The msgids inside curly-brace-references are matched case-insensitively \r\n by default, the --sensitive option expands case-sensitive matches only.\r\n  \r\n* -c, --count    \r\n\r\n Returns the number of references contained in the source file, regardless\r\n    of whether the references are valid and can be expanded. No output file \r\n    is written. Can be used as a second pass to confirm all references have\r\n    been expanded (none were misspelled etc), but\r\n\t\r\n WARNING: Plural forms are not supported and references contained in \r\n    plural-form msgstrs are not counted.\r\n\t\r\n#### Returns:\r\n * 0 - Success\r\n * 1 - fatal error - invalid arguments or file permissions.\r\n * 2 - fatal error - non-specific.\r\n * 3 - one or more warnings or non-fatal errors occurred.\r\n * less than 0 - Success, but not all references could be expanded, the\r\n                  negative return value indicates how may references were\r\n                  found that could not be expanded.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
